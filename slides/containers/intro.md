## A brief introduction

- These materials reuse work done by [Jérôme Petazzoni](https://twitter.com/jpetazzo) and [multiple contributors](https://@@GITREPO@@/graphs/contributors)

- I have included as much information as possible in these slides

- ... but be comfortable spending some time reading the Docker
 [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/) ...

- ... And looking for answers in the [Docker forums](https://forums.docker.com),
  [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/docker),
  and other outlets

class: self-paced

## Hands on, you shall practice

- Nobody ever became a Jedi by spending their lives reading Wookiepedia

- Likewise, it will take more than merely *reading* these slides
  to make you an expert

- These slides include *tons* of demos, exercises, and examples

- They assume that you have access to a machine running Docker

- If you are attending a workshop or tutorial:
  <br/>you will be given specific instructions to access a cloud VM

- If you are doing this on your own:
  <br/>we will tell you how to install Docker or access a Docker environment
